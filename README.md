## About

Welcome to my current developer portfolio! This project blends technology and creativity, showcasing immersive web experiences, 3D implementation, and dynamic animations. From customizable 3D models to framer motion animations, each section highlights skills and achievements of my web development path so far. The 3D skills section merges three.js and react three fiber, while responsive design ensures optimal viewing. My portfolio goes beyond showcasing skills, offering an immersive experience resonating with creativity and the potential of web development.
